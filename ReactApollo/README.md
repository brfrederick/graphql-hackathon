# Apollo React Hackathon Starter Kit

This demonstrates simple parameterized queries and routing. Get the full details about using Apollo with React in [the official Apollo docs](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/).

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/apollostack/frontpage-react-app
cd frontpage-react-app
npm install
```

## Starting the app

This app talks to the GraphQL server found in the same repository.

Once you've installed and started that server, start this app with:

```
npm start
```

It will open a browser window, or you can browse to http://localhost:3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Relay requires a schema.json description of the GraphQL server schema for its Babel plugin. Run
`npm run update-schema` in the `../server/` directory to generate that file.

Run this example with `npm start`. It will run on port 3000.
